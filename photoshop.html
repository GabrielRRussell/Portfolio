                <h3>Quick Works</h3>
                <p>I have done a few illustrations in Photoshop and Illustrator. Below, you can find a few of my favorite pieces that I have designed in the past semester.</p>
                
                <p>For a short period of time, I was requested to do wallpapers for friends and colleagues, so these are what I had been designing.</p>
