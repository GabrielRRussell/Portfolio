                <h1 class = "title_main_sub">Software Design</h1>
                
                <p>I do software development. Anything from games to small pieces of software, to pranks: I make it. I specialize in console homebrew.</p>
                
                <a href = "https://github.com/Kaisogen"><p>Here is my Github, where you can see my projects that I have open sourced!</p></a> 
                
                <p>In the past, I have developed primarily homebrew and have a kindling interest in irregular platforms. I want to get into embedded platform work, as it seems like something I'd be interested in. I also developed short microcontroller code for the Arduino and its knockoffs. </p>
                
                <p>I personally have worked with multiple languages and frameworks. I know some C, basic Lua, basic C#, HTML/CSS/JS, and started work with Bootstrap, and various other frameworks. I also have started experimentation with more unique languages, such as COBOL and Brainfuck. I don't expect those two to pan out fully though. Fun fact, this website is my first bootstrap site. You can find the source on my github account!</p>

                <h1 class = "title_main_sub">Photoshop and Illustrator</h1>
                
                <p>I dabble in design with Photoshop, Illustrator, and other tools.</p>
                
                <p><a href = "photoshop.html">Here </a>is a page full of things I have designed in Photoshop and Illustrator. </p>
                
                <p>I have never used Photoshop for any professional projects, but rather school assignments and personal projects for friends. This last semester of 2017 I was required to learn Photoshop and Illustrator, so I took the opportunity as a learning experience. I designed several posters and wallpapers over the course of the semester. Alongside photo editing, I also messed around with simple video masking in Photoshop.</p>

                <h1 class = "title_main_sub">Photography</h1>
                
                <p>While I don't have a fancy DSLR, I do like taking pretty pictures. Any place can make for a good scene with a good shot.</p>
                
                <p>Click <a href = "pictures.html">here </a> for some pictures I have taken in the past.</p>
                
                <p>I am primarily interested in software, so being a photographer never really took my interest until recently. I take photos with my phone, an iPhone 5C. While having an outdated camera, I still stand by the philosophy that the quality of the picture doesn't matter, it is the shot itself. A bad angle or subject cannot be overcome by a higher resolution.</p>
